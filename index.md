# Welcome to Approaching Reality - the blog of J. Allen Baron

Where I describe how data can be used to draw ever closer to ground truth... and lead to major improvement!


## Defining my approach:

- Flexible: I find tools, build bridges, and chart whatever path in search of meaningful insights.
- Validated: I ensure results and insights are accurate... the only way they can be when seeking truth.
- Focused: Truth is nice, but it has to be functional for improvement.
- Human-oriented: People are our greatest resource. I value them, respect them, and work to enhance their prosperity.
